# Petals Around the Rose [SOURCE WEBSITE](http://www.borrett.id.au/computing/petals-j.htm)
## About
 - This game to my knowledge was originally made by Lloyd Robert Borrett which is also available on his website. 
 - This game is about trying to figure out how the value is generated, for a better explaination go to the original website. Also try out his implimentation. 
 - I would highly recommend not to read the source code or look the answer up as that would completely ruin the puzzle forever. 
## Files
 - The `text_peta...py` file is for playing the game in a text interactive way, the `image_gen_peta...py` file is for generating images that correspond to the values. 
 - if you guess correctly 10 times in a row in `text_peta...py`, the file will close indicating your victory.
